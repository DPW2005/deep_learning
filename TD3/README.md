# DeepLearning_3 — TP3: CNN & Computer Vision

## Objectives
This repository contains the solutions for Practical Work 3 on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Computer Vision:
- Preparation and classification of CIFAR-10 images
- Implementation of residual blocks (ResNet)
- Concepts of segmentation and detection
- Style transfer with VGG16

## Repository Structure
- `cnn_classification.py`: main file for data preparation, classic CNN, residual blocks, and style transfer sections

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.8+ and pip
2. Install dependencies:
	 ```bash
	 pip install -r requirements.txt
	 ```

## Usage

To train the classic CNN model:
```bash
python cnn_classification.py
```

All code sections (classic CNN, residual blocks, style transfer) are included in this file as per the TP instructions.
